                capacity is 45 / 9 = 5 Liters/ Hour. Second pipe fills the tank in 5 hours. So its capacity is 45 / 5
                = 9 Liters/Hour. If both pipes are opened together, then combined capacity is 14 liters/hour. To
                fill a tank of capacity 45 liters, Both pipes takes 45 / 14 = 3.21 Hours.</p></div>

                purchasing power? Infact, they have less purchasing power as they have to feed more
                people. Option A ruled out.
                Option C does not explain why rural households have more purchasing power than urban. Ruled
                out.
                If median income of urban and suburban households is generally higher than rural households
                they are likely to have more purchasing power, assuming other parameters constant. But this
                does not explain why rural households have more purchasing power. Options D ruled out.
                Option E does not provide any explanation why rural households have more purchasing power.
                Ruled out.
                Option B is correct as, If rural households spend less income on food and shelter due to less

                Given tank hight = 4ft.
                ⇒⇒ πr24πr24 = 36ππ
                ⇒⇒ r = 3
                So the radius is 3 which means the diameter is 6.
                As the cylinder is filled to initially exactly half of the capacity, When this cylinder is placed on its
                side, Water comes upto the height of the radius.

                worker on the day of the crew. If the night crew has 4/5 as many workers as the day crew, what

                Assume the worked on dayshift = 5, then workers on night shift = 4

                We know that total factors of a number which is in the format of aP×bQ×cR...aP×bQ×cR... = (P +
                1). (Q + 1). (R + 1) .... = (2 + 1).(1 + 1) = 6
                Also odd factors of any number can be calculated easily by not taking 2 and its powers.
                So odd factors of 22×P122×P1 = the factors of P1P1 = (1 + 1) = 2

                pounds
                So, 1.15 x = 207 pounds
